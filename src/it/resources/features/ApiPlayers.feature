Feature: Execute a lifecycle of a player in the card game
  In order to execute the lifecycle of a player

    Given I try to get a player with invalid "<id>"
    Then I should see that the response has HTTP status "<HTTP status code>"
    And The json response body should be like Player not found

    Examples: This is the default Human Player

      | id   | avatar | alias     | human | aiLevel | cubits | securedLoan | HTTP status code |
      | 1234 | ELF    | Cukes Doe | true  | HUMAN   | 0      | 0           | 404              |
