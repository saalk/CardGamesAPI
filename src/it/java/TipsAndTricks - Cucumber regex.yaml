# Regex quick reference

# Some people are uncomfortable with Regular Expressions.
Given /^I have (\d+) cucumbers in my belly$/
# It’s also possible to define Step Definitions using strings and $variables like this:
Given "I have $count cucumbers in my belly"

[abc]		A single character of: a, b, or c
[^abc]		Any single character except: a, b, or c
[a-z]		Any single character in the range a-z
[a-zA-Z]	Any single character in the range a-z or A-Z
^			Start of line
$			End of line
\A			Start of string
\z			End of string
.			Any single character
\s			Any whitespace character
\S			Any non-whitespace character
\d			Any digit
\D			Any non-digit
\w			Any word character (letter, number, underscore)
\W			Any non-word character
\b			Any word boundary
(...)		Capture everything enclosed
(a|b)		a or b
a?			Zero or one of a
a*			Zero or more of a
a+			One or more of a
a{3}		Exactly 3 of a
a{3,}		3 or more of a
a{3,6}		Between 3 and 6 of a

# Handy

"[^\"]*" 	matches something (or nothing) in double Quotes "foo", "foo bar" or "12345"
? 			makes the previous character or group optional 	/an?/ matches a and an but not n
| 			like a logical OR; can be used with parentheses to include an OR in a larger pattern
			/I’m|I am/ matches I’m and I am
			/I (eat|ate)/ matches I eat and I ate
(pattern) 	a group; typically used in Cucumber to capture a Substring argument
			/(\d+) users/ matches 3 users and captures the 3 for use later
(?:pattern) a non-capturing group
			/I (?:eat|ate)/ matches I eat and I ate but does not capture eat or ate for use later

# Ambiguous steps
Consider these step definitions:
Given /Three (.*) mice/
Given /Three blind (.*)/
And a plain text step:
Given Three blind mice
Cucumber can’t make a decision about what Step Definition to execute, and will raise a
Cucumber::Ambiguous error telling you to fix the ambiguity.
In Cucumber you’re not allowed to use a regexp more than once in a Step Definition:
even across files
