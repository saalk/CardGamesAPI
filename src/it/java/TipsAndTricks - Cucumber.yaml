## Cucumber
Cucumber is used for testing other software.
It runs automated acceptance tests written in a behavior-driven development (BDD) style

# 2 - Configuring JUnit to Work with Cucumber
JUnit tests are started using the JUnitCore class. JUnitCore then uses reflection to find an
appropriate Runner for the passed test classes. One step here is to look for a @RunWith annotations.
If no other Runner is found the default runner: (BlockJUnit4ClassRunner) will be used.
In order for JUnit to be aware of Cucumber and read feature files when running,
the Cucumber class: must be declared as the Runner.
NB
A JUnit Runner is the class that extends JUnit's abstract Runner class.
- The Suite Runner is used to create test suites. Suites are collections of tests (or other suites).
- Mockito provides MockitoJUnitRunner for automatic mock initialization.
- GuiceJUnitRunner gives you the option to inject Guice components in JUnit tests.
- Spring's SpringJUnit4ClassRunner helps you test Spring framework applications.

# JUnit will invoke the Cucumber class it references to run the tests in that class instead of
# the runner built into JUnit.
@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(features = "classpath:Feature")
public class CucumberTest { // }


# 2 - Gherkin: the language that Cucumber uses to define test cases TDD or BDD
Feature: A feature is a Use Case that describes a specific function
Scenario: Each Feature is made of a collection of scenarios.
Given 	= STATE current state of the system to be explored
When 	= EVENT describes an event or stimulus to that system
Then 	= NEW STATE describes the resulting state of the system, invoking an action
And 	= Logical and
But 	= Logically the same as And, but used in the negative form

GIVEN/WHEN/THEN is nothing more than a description of a state transition,
and the sum of all the GIVEN/WHEN/THEN statement is nothing more than a Finite State Machine.

If we are in the LOCKED state, and we get a COIN event, then we go to the UNLOCKED state,
and we invoke the Unlock action.

If we are in the LOCKED state, and we get a PASS event, then we stay in the LOCKED state,
and we invoke the Alarm action.

# A Scenario Outline provides a technique to specify multiple examples to test against
# a template scenario by using placeholders
Scenario Outline: A user withdraws money from an ATM
    Given <Name> has a valid Credit or Debit card
    And their account balance is <OriginalBalance>
    When they insert their card
    And withdraw <WithdrawalAmount>
    Then the ATM should return <WithdrawalAmount>
    And their account balance is <NewBalance>

    Examples:
      | Name   | OriginalBalance | WithdrawalAmount | NewBalance |
      | Eric   | 100             | 45               | 55         |
      | Pranav | 100             | 40               | 60         |
      | Ed     | 1000            | 200              | 800        |

# At runtime the scenario is run against each row in the table. Column values are substituted
# for each of the named placeholders in the scenario.
Another important element, called glue, provides paths to step definitions. However, if the test
case and step definitions are in the same package, that element may be dropped.


# 3 - Writing Step definitions
When Cucumber parses steps, it will search for methods annotated with Gherkin keywords to locate
the matching step definitions.
The ^...$

Example 1:
@Given("(.*) has a valid Credit or Debit card")
public void has_card(String name) {
    // // method implementation
}
Example 2:
@When("^users want to get information on the (.+) project$")
public void usersGetInformationOnAProject(String projectName) throws IOException {
}
(.+) : argument
Method for example 2:
HttpGet request = new HttpGet("http://localhost:8080/projects/" + projectName.toLowerCase());
request.addHeader("accept", "application/json");
HttpResponse httpResponse = httpClient.execute(request);
Or:
// jsonString => a JSON string { "name" "value"}
HttpPost request = new HttpPost("http://localhost:8080/create");
StringEntity entity = new StringEntity(jsonString);
request.addHeader("content-type", "application/json");
request.setEntity(entity);
HttpResponse response = httpClient.execute(request);
Assert the POST:
assertEquals(200, response.getStatusLine().getStatusCode());
verify(postRequestedFor(urlEqualTo("/create"))
  .withHeader("content-type", equalTo("application/json")));
assertThat(responseString, containsString( some tring));


# 4 - Formatter plugins
Cucumber uses Formatter Plugins to provide output. Several common formats are provided by default,
including JSON, HTML, JUnit
