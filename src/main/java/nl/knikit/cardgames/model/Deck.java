/**
 * <H2>Description</H2>A "standard" deck of playing cards consists of 52 {@link Card Cards}; 13 in each of
 * the 4 Enum {@link Suit suits} of the following list <ul> <li>{@link Suit Spades} <li>{@link Suit
 * Hearts} <li>{@link Suit Diamonds} <li>{@link Suit Clubs} </ul> <p>The ranks have symbols, so
 * called face cards: ace, king, queen, and jack or numbers ranging from 2 to 10. Optionally one or
 * more jokers can be added while generating a deck.
 * <H2>Relations</H2>
 * Deck 'HAS-A' relationship with a preset list of Cards. It is codified via <b>Composition</b> because
 * you must have Card(s) in a Deck and dealing does not remove Cards (like in real world) so 'new()' is
 * placed in the constructor or a setter.<p> {@code ArrayList<Card>
 * cards;}<br>{@code Deck() {cards = new ArrayList<>()}; loop to add Card to list of cards;}
 * <p><img src="../../../../../../src/main/resources/plantuml/Deck.png" alt="UML">

 * <H3>NB -&gt; Relationships on instance-level</H3>
 * Relations between instances of Classes have the following UML notations<ol>
 * <li><b>Dependency (often confused as Association)</b> - a uni directional reference between a dependent and independent elements.<br>
 * class A -USES- class B: represented by a dashed arrow starting from the dependent class to its dependency.<br>
 * codified: as a parameter via a method or as a local instance reference with new in a method. You only need to import B in A.<br>
 * example: PlayerOld - Die via the PlayerOld.takeTurn(Die die) method that has die.Roll() reference to the Roll method of die.
 * <li><b>Association</b> - a uni or bi directional reference between two classes.<br>
 * class A -NOUN- class B: represented by a line, arrows indicate navigation, has multiplicity at one (uni) or both (bi) ends.<br>
 * codified: define an instance of the associated class and passed in it's setter or constructor.<br>
 * example: Passenger -books- Flight via the class Passenger;Flight flight;setFlight(Flight bookedFlight){} setter.
 * Also Student -enrolls- Course.
 * <li><b>Aggregation</b> - a one-to-many association with separate lifecycles.<br>
 * class A -HAS-A- class B: represented by a line with a hollow diamond at the containing class and 1..* at the collection side.<br>
 * codified: like association but with a list of instances of the associated class.<br>
 * The referenced Object is created (new) outside referring class and then passed as a parameter via setter or method.<br>
 * example: Professor - Class: class Professor;List&gt;Class&lt; classes;addClass(Class newClass){} method.
 * <li><b>Composition</b> - a strong lifecycle dependent association.<br>
 * class A -OWNS- class B: represented by a line with a solid diamond at the containing class and 1..1/2/n at the collection side.<br>
 * codified: like association but via a private final instance variables reference and constructed (new()) in the class constructor.
 * The encapsulated / composed Object (part) is destroyed when the referring / composite Object (whole) is destroyed.
 * Other classes cannot see or use the composed Object.<br>
 * example: Car - Engine: class Car;Engine engine = new Engine;Car(Engine newEngine){}; constructor.
 * </li></ol>
 * <H3>NB -&gt; Relationships on class-level</H3><ol>
 * <li><b>Generalization (also called Specialization)</b> - indicates that one of the two related classes is specialized form or the other.<br>
 * class A IS-A-(SUB)TYPE-OF class B: represented by a line with a hollow triangle shape on the superclass.<br>
 * codified: on class level with A Extends B. Known as inheritance, the superclass (base class) is usually abstract.<br>
 * example: Professor|Student extends Person {}.
 * <li><b>Realization</b> - indicates a contract between a subsystem or framework and its consumer.<br>
 * class A IS-A-KIND-OF class B: represented by a dotted or dashed line and a hollow triangle shape on the interface class.
 * codified: on class level with interface A {};class B implements A {};
 * example: A implements Clonable, Comparable {}.
 * </li></ol>
